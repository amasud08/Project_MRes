This project was conducted as a Masters thesis project for the CDT in geospatial systems at the University of Newcastle. The Google Earth Engine (GEE) API in Python was used in this project.

This research aimed to analyse urbanisation in Addis Ababa using urban spectral indices, whilst evaluating the performance of urban indices in automatically detecting urban land use land cover. This research did this by comparing and assessing 5 urban indices: 

1. Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI)
2. Modified Normalized Difference Built-up Index (MNDBI)
3. Index‐based Built‐up Index (IBI)
4. Enhanced Normalised Difference Impervious Surfaces Index (ENDISI)
5. Perpendicular Impervious Surface Index (PISI)

This Github repository is organised with the following information:

* data (Data that was not obtained from GEE)
* graphs (Plots produced from the data analysis)
* maps (Maps produced from the data analysis)
* metadata (Project Metadata)
* notebooks (Source code for this project)
